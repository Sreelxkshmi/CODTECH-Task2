Project Name: Linear Regression for Salary Prediction


Objective:
Developed a simple linear regression model to predict employee salaries based on their age using a synthetic dataset. The goal is to understand the relationship between age and salary and evaluate the model's performance.

Key Activities:

Create or Load Dataset:
Generated a synthetic dataset containing Age and Salary.
Explore the Dataset:
Displayed the first few rows and summary statistics.
Visualized relationships using pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
Prepare Data for Modeling:
Split the dataset into features (Age) and target variable (Salary).
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Linear Regression Model:
Initialized and trained a linear regression model on the training data.
Displayed the model's intercept and coefficient.
Make Predictions:
Predicted salaries on the test set and compared with actual values.
Evaluate the Model:
Calculated and displayed Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared value.
Visualize the Results:
Plotted the regression line with the actual data points.
Created a scatter plot for actual vs. predicted values.


Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used.
pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For creating visualizations and plots.
Tools: Jupyter notebook
seaborn: For advanced data visualization (pair plots, heatmaps).
sklearn: For linear regression modeling and performance metrics.
About:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on employee age. It includes data preparation, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization of results to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.
